# TECH-A-THON-Emotion-Based-Movie-Recommender-System
The purpose of the movie recommendation system is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual as per his/her current mood. It makes use of supervised machine learning algorithms to build a deep learning model that creates a customized list of movies that are relevant to an individual. This can be achieved through predictive modeling and heuristics with the data available.

## OVERVIEW
The user will be given two options, either to enter his/her mood preference or to simply give a speech input and let the system decide the mood of the user. Thereafter, the system will then recommend the movies.
The project consists of two components:
Component 1: Speech Emotion Recognition System
Component 2: Movie Recommendation System

## MOTIVATION AND GOAL
The existing movie recommender systems (Netflix, Amazon Prime, 123movies, FMovies, etc.) work on browsing history of an individual, ratings of the movie, genres, popularity and trends. This project model will complement such systems by providing a new filter.

## ABOUT THE DATASET
We will use the RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song) dataset that contains 7356 files. It is one of the most common datasets used for this exercise because of its quality of speakers, recording and it has 24 actors of different genders. Here's the filename identifiers as per the official RAVDESS website:
•	Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only).
•	Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song).
•	Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised).
•	Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion.
•	Statement (01 = "Kids are talking by the door", 02 = "Dogs are sitting by the door").
•	Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition).
•	Actor (01 to 24. Odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female).
